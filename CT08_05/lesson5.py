# a) A dolphin jumps out of the water during a dolphin show. The height, 𝑦 𝑚, of
# the dolphin is given by 𝑦 = −4.5𝑡
# 2 + 9𝑡 , where 𝑡 is the time in seconds after
# the dolphin jumps out of the water.
# (i) Express 𝑦 = −4.5𝑡
# 2 + 9𝑡 in the form 𝑦 = 𝑎(𝑡 − ℎ)
# 2 + 𝑘 .
# (ii) How long did it take the dolphin to reach the maximum height and
# what is the maximum height?
# (iii) Find the range of values of t where the height of the dolphin is at least
# 3.375 m.

# (i) -4.5(t+4.5)^2 -20.25 (ii) 4.5t^2 -9t 
# = 4.5(t+4.5)^2 -(4.5)^2 
# = 4.5(t+4.5)^2 =20.25 
# = 1((t/4.5)+1)^2 = 4.5444(5sf) 
# = ((t/4.5)+1)^2 = 4.5555(5sf) 
# = ((t/4.5)+1)^2 = 4.5555(5sf) 
# = (t + 4.5)^2 = 4.5555(5sf) 
# = t + 4.5 = /(4.5555(5sf)) 
# = t = /(4.5555(5sf)) - 4.5 
# = t = 2.13(3sf) - 4.5 
# = t = -2.37(3sf) or t = -/(4.5555(5sf)) - 4.5 = t = -6.63(3sf) 
# Therefore, x = 2.13(3sf) or x = - 6.63(3sf)
